As the area of the search squares increases, the average runtime with the R-tree increases as well. The average runtime with the standard indices stays more or less consistent, increasing slightly at the beginning and then decreasing again as the search squares get much larger. This shows the R-tree evaluating the bounding box all at once, iterating over more values the larger the box is, and the standard indices applying its conditions one after the other, keeping the search time roughly equivalent to iterating over the database a set number of times. However, the R-tree is much more efficient, never taking up even as much as 1% of the standard indices' runtime in these trials.
